# Specify keys for classes in the data model.  These define which types can be
# stored in 'object' bags and are used for porting those bags to new releases.
# chenyian: Generally speaking, these attributes determinate which attribute can be 'LOOK UP', 
#           which attribute can be used for uploading as a list, 
#           and which attribute can be clicked in the result table.
# chenyian: the display format of search results also controlled by these settings together with the webconfig-model file. 
#           webconfig-model decide the display fields and this file determine if the filed should be bold at the first line.
